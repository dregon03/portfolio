        <p>
          Hi, I'm <strong class="text-surface-900 dark:text-surface-100">Sung Woo Hwang</strong>,
          but most people call me Tom. I'm an economist based in Ottawa with a
          master's degree in economics. By day, I work at the Privy Council
          Office. By night, I build things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live two lives and I like it that way. My day job is analytical
          — working with national-level data, internal trade policy, and
          economic indicators. But whenever I have the time, I'm building apps
          that I feel are missing from the world. If something doesn't exist and
          I want it to, I'll build it myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          What drives me is giving meaning to people through the products I
          create — whether that's a dashboard that makes complex data
          understandable, or a language learning tool that makes Korean
          accessible to beginners. I care about making things that are useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work and code, you'll find me on the badminton court. I'm
          drawn to fast-paced, entrepreneurial cities — San Francisco, Seattle,
          Bengaluru, Shenzhen — places where people are building the future.
        </p>
