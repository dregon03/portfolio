Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm Tom — a software developer who loves building things that solve real problems. I've been meaning to start writing for a while, and this is the beginning.

## Why a blog?

Building software is only half the story. The other half is the thinking behind it — the decisions, the trade-offs, the things that didn't work. I want to share that process here.

## What to expect

I'll write about:

- **Projects I'm building** — the technical details and the reasoning behind them
- **Things I'm learning** — new tools, frameworks, and ideas
- **Reflections** — on the craft of software development and the industry

If any of that sounds interesting, stick around. There's more to come.
