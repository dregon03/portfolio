Project Alpha is a collaborative document editor built for teams that need to work together in real time. It features live cursors, inline comments, and automatic version history.

The backend uses WebSockets for real-time sync and PostgreSQL for persistent storage. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript for type safety across the entire stack.
