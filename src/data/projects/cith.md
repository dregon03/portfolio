The Canadian Internal Trade Data and Information Hub (CITH) is a centralized data repository launched in April 2024 as part of the Federal Action Plan to Strengthen Internal Trade. It provides Canadians with free, reliable, and timely data on interprovincial commerce, labour mobility, and trade barriers to support business decisions, policy-making, and research.
