Data is only useful if people can understand it. Project Gamma transforms raw datasets into interactive dashboards with charts, filters, and drill-down capabilities.

The backend is powered by FastAPI with a data processing pipeline, while the frontend uses Svelte and D3.js for smooth, performant visualizations.
